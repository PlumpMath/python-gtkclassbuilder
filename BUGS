* pydoc doesn't pick up public functions from gtkclassbuilder.__init__, because
  they're imported from sub-modules.
* docs are a bit confusing when talking about the child elements of "<child>"
  elements; we should find a clearer way to talk about this.
* setup.py is missing a dependency on gtk. should figure out what the right
  package name is and add it.
