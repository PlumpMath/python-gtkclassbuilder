* docs are a bit confusing when talking about the child elements of "<child>"
  elements; we should find a clearer way to talk about this.
* We can't set the "model" property correctly; we need access to the dictionary
  to do that. (specifies the name of an object).
* Overrides currently need to be done on a per-class basis, but many classes
  will have the same property with the same meaning. We should be able to set
  global defaults.
